# SINet Dashboard: Music Portal Integration Guide

## Overview

The Music Portal integration demonstrates the SINet Dashboard's capabilities for rich media management and external API integration. This document provides detailed information about the Music Portal component, its API endpoints, and implementation details for developers looking to extend or customize the integration.

## Architecture

The Music Portal integration consists of several components:

1. **Backend API Proxy**: SINet Dashboard endpoints that proxy requests to the Ninja Portal backend
2. **Music Player Component**: React component for media playback
3. **Music Context Provider**: Global state management for the player
4. **Modal Interface**: Persistent player that works across application navigation

## API Endpoints

### Recent Songs

Retrieves a list of recently added songs from the music portal.

- **Endpoint**: `/api/music-portal/recent-songs`
- **Method**: `GET`
- **Implementation**: The endpoint connects to `https://ninja-portal.com/api/songs/recent` to fetch the latest songs and returns the data in a standardized format.
- **Response Example**:
  ```json
  [
    {
      "id": "70",
      "title": "Pour it On",
      "artist": "Flaukowski",
      "addedAt": "2025-02-13T00:04:11.038Z",
      "votes": 169
    },
    {
      "id": "54",
      "title": "AI Dream",
      "artist": "Flaukowski",
      "addedAt": "2025-02-06T13:43:58.222Z",
      "votes": 50
    }
  ]
  ```

### Stream Song

Streams the audio content of a specific song.

- **Endpoint**: `/api/music-portal/stream/:id`
- **Method**: `GET`
- **Implementation**: The endpoint redirects to the appropriate stream URL from Ninja Portal. For demo purposes, it redirects to a sample MP3 file.
- **Response**: Audio stream or redirect to audio file

### Song Artwork

Retrieves the artwork image for a specific song.

- **Endpoint**: `/api/music-portal/artwork/:id`
- **Method**: `GET`
- **Implementation**: The endpoint redirects to the artwork image URL from Ninja Portal. For demo purposes, it redirects to a placeholder image.
- **Response**: Image file or redirect to image URL

## Frontend Implementation

### Music Player Modal

The Music Player Modal provides a persistent player interface that remains accessible as users navigate through the application. Key features include:

1. **Persistent Playback**: Audio continues playing during navigation
2. **Minimizable Interface**: Can be collapsed to reduce screen space usage
3. **Global State**: Player state is maintained across all components

Implementation:

```jsx
// MusicPlayerModal.tsx
import { Dialog, DialogContent } from "@/components/ui/dialog";
import { Button } from "@/components/ui/button";
import { MinimizeIcon, X } from "lucide-react";
import { MusicPlayer } from "@/components/MusicPlayer";
import { useMusicPlayer } from "@/lib/MusicPlayerContext";
import { useState } from "react";

export function MusicPlayerModal() {
  const { isPlayerOpen, currentSong, closePlayer } = useMusicPlayer();
  const [minimized, setMinimized] = useState(false);

  if (!currentSong) return null;

  // URLs for the player
  const songUrl = `/api/music-portal/stream/${currentSong.id}`;
  const coverUrl = `/api/music-portal/artwork/${currentSong.id}`;

  const handleMinimize = () => {
    setMinimized(!minimized);
  };

  return (
    <Dialog open={isPlayerOpen} onOpenChange={(open) => !open && closePlayer()}>
      <DialogContent 
        className={minimized ? "max-w-[300px] p-2 bottom-4 right-4 fixed" : "max-w-md"}
        onInteractOutside={(e) => e.preventDefault()} // Prevent closing when clicking outside
      >
        {/* Dialog content with player component */}
      </DialogContent>
    </Dialog>
  );
}
```

### Music Player Context

The Music Player Context provides global state management for the player, ensuring that playback state is maintained across navigation:

```jsx
// MusicPlayerContext.tsx
import React, { createContext, useContext, useState, ReactNode } from 'react';

// Song type definition
export interface Song {
  id: string;
  title: string;
  artist: string;
  addedAt: string;
}

interface MusicPlayerContextType {
  isPlayerOpen: boolean;
  currentSong: Song | null;
  openPlayer: (song: Song) => void;
  closePlayer: () => void;
  isPlaying: boolean;
  togglePlayPause: () => void;
}

const MusicPlayerContext = createContext<MusicPlayerContextType | undefined>(undefined);

export function MusicPlayerProvider({ children }: { children: ReactNode }) {
  const [isPlayerOpen, setIsPlayerOpen] = useState(false);
  const [currentSong, setCurrentSong] = useState<Song | null>(null);
  const [isPlaying, setIsPlaying] = useState(false);

  const openPlayer = (song: Song) => {
    setCurrentSong(song);
    setIsPlayerOpen(true);
    setIsPlaying(true);
  };

  const closePlayer = () => {
    setIsPlayerOpen(false);
    // Note: we don't reset the current song so it can resume if reopened
  };

  const togglePlayPause = () => {
    setIsPlaying(!isPlaying);
  };

  return (
    <MusicPlayerContext.Provider
      value={{
        isPlayerOpen,
        currentSong,
        openPlayer,
        closePlayer,
        isPlaying,
        togglePlayPause
      }}
    >
      {children}
    </MusicPlayerContext.Provider>
  );
}

export function useMusicPlayer() {
  const context = useContext(MusicPlayerContext);
  if (context === undefined) {
    throw new Error('useMusicPlayer must be used within a MusicPlayerProvider');
  }
  return context;
}
```
